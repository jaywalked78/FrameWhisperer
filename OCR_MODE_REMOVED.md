# OCR-Only Mode Removal Notice

## Important Update

The OCR-Only mode has been permanently removed from the application as per requirements. All processing will now use LLM (Language Model) analysis regardless of environment variables or command-line flags.

## What Was Changed

The following changes have been made:

1. The `OCR_ONLY_MODE` variable is now permanently set to `False` in both `process_frames_by_path.py` and `process_frames_by_path_Reverse.py`.
2. The `--ocr-only` command-line argument has been removed from both Python scripts.
3. All JavaScript worker scripts have been updated to ignore any `OCR_ONLY_MODE` environment variables.
4. Shell scripts like `force_ocr_only_mode.sh` and `run_sequential_ocr_Reverse.sh` have been updated to inform users that OCR-only mode is no longer available.

## Affected Files

- `process_frames_by_path.py`
- `process_frames_by_path_Reverse.py`
- `process_remaining_frames_sequential.js`
- `process_remaining_frames_reverse.js`
- `force_ocr_only_mode.sh`
- `run_sequential_ocr_Reverse.sh`

## What This Means

- All OCR processing will now include LLM analysis
- Setting the `OCR_ONLY_MODE` environment variable will have no effect
- The `--ocr-only` command-line argument is no longer supported
- The system will always attempt to use the configured Gemini model for text analysis

## Error Handling

Even if no valid API key is provided, the system will attempt to use LLM processing. If the API calls fail, the system will handle these errors gracefully while continuing to process frames.

## Using the Updated Scripts

- To process frames, use the standard commands without the `--ocr-only` flag:

```bash
python process_frames_by_path.py --folder-path "/path/to/folder" --skip-airtable-update
python process_frames_by_path_Reverse.py --folder-path "/path/to/folder" --skip-airtable-update
```

- You can still specify a Gemini model using the `--model` parameter:

```bash
python process_frames_by_path.py --folder-path "/path/to/folder" --model "models/gemini-2.0-flash"
```
